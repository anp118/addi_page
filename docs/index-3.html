        <h1>My childhood dogs:</h1>
        <p> These are my childhood dogs, Daisy and Lily. I grew up with them by my side and they were the best dogs a young girl could ever ask for. Shortly before Daisy passed, I got my first tattoo. It is a boquet of daisies and lilies on my side in honor of them. They will always hold a special place in my heart. </p>

        <p class= "happy">My dogs loved Christmas so much. Lily would just watch us open gifts, but Daisy loved to tear into wrapping paper. They always got gifts from Santa and Daisy was always thrilled to open them. </p>
    <p class= "sad"> Daisy passed in July 2023 and the first Christmas without her was hard. We still had Lily, but her health was declining and she wasn't herself without Daisy. We tried to enjoy the holiday, but it was hard. Lily passed in August of 2024 and my family was dreading a Christmas with no dogs. In November of that year, just in time for Christmas, we adopted Charlie and had a hectic Christmas with a tiny puppy. </p>
